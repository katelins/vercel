    <h1>Betina and Katelin's Website</h1>
    <p>We would very much like to win the $30 Amazon gift card. Betina has no money. Katelin also has no money. They are saving up to afford an educational experience at college. Their only hope in life is that others are kind enough to consider them for this wonderful award. Thank you. Amen.</p>
